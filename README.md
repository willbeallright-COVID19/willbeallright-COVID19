## ABOUT
One place for all necessary information during COVID-19 layoffs for employers, employees, and people who've been recently laid off.
The intention of this document is to put all necessary information in one easily accessible and community modifiable place.
Layoffs are hard and sucks. I just want to let you know you’re not alone.

I am located in Berlin, Germany, so I’m going to focus on the Germany area but if you have resources for another area please feel encouraged to send a PR!
P.S. Most of the informations are also applicable to other locations.

## ROADMAP
**What is it, and why this?**
In the middle of April 20', we decided at our company to act as a job finding concierge to each software engineer impacted by COVID-19 layoff in Germany. Of course, the pandemic has an impact on our team and growth too, however, we still have resources and market knowledge to help, and we think it’s the right thing to do.

During that time, while helping engineers to stay connected to job opportunities. We needed to find a lot of information ourselves. A massive volume of layoff news on the Internet like spreadsheets "who are hiring,"; "who is laying off"; Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook articles focused on the topic of COVID-19 layoff started to become unmanageable, it was difficult to separate accurate information from noise.

So, I was looking for a collaborative place where I can put all information found during our "concierge project" to share it with the community, especially because there are so much mutually exclusive information and so many amazing & helpful resources I had no idea of existing. I believe there should be an easily accessible place for people in need. And Github seems to be the place.

## WHO AM I
I am Alex Jozwik, ex-lawyer, ex-UN in Geneva and NYC, co-founder of CodersFirst and Diversity & Inclusion Advocate.

Disclaimer: I’m not your lawyer or a lawyer anymore, and I’m not a financial advisor. Any advice below is just that (advice. One person’s opinion). I wanted to centralize resources I’ve seen from news outlets and anyone else on the hunt for jobs right now.

Although most of the information I pulled here or going to pull were found or prepared for CodersFirst’s candidates, however, **willbeallright-COVID19** has no link to the company and is my private project. I will not comment specifically on CodersFirst.

I am motivated by a single purpose: To help employers, employees, and people who've been recently laid off a) help people stay connected to job opportunities b) help to find yourself in this unpleasant situation c) emotionally support d) give details and context on layoff topic well enough to make better decisions themselves.
The place aims to be practical (with concrete suggestions and pitfalls to avoid).

I would like to however stress that I am not perfect and the guide shouldn’t be seen as completed. A reference like this is always in process. That’s why I chose Github to enable the community to suggest improvements, contribute new sections, and call out anything that needs revision. I welcome (and will gladly credit) your help.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
I am building it as an open-source project. I add here or going to add information we found during our “concierge project”. I believe that community cooperation might be more beneficial than only my point of view, so I welcome active contributors!

## START FROM HERE
### After layoff notification
Breathe. I know being layoffs sucks and during the pandemic, time might be even harder to handle. Take your time. Breathe. It’s ok to feel sad, angry, or doubtfully, take care of yourself on every stage of the process.

Here is information you need to have after being notified about canceling your role. If HR people didn’t give you those details, reach out to them immediately.

1. How long the company is going to pay you?
2. Do you receive a severance package/pay?
3. How long will you have to exercise your stock options?
4. Do you receive references from the company?
5. By when can you keep a company computer/related equipment? This is also a really important question, especially when this is the only computer you own at the moment. All activities are remote now, public libraries are closed and it might be difficult to search for a new job without access to the internet. Also, many recruitment processes are conducting remotely. if you can’t keep the computer ask the company if you can keep it at least on loan until you find your next job.
6. What about all the personal items you have on the company computer? How can you get this information back? While you shouldn’t have personal data on the corporate machine, the reality is almost everyone does. Ask the company how much time do you have to get your files in order.

### Mental and physical health

1. Layoff may cause serious emotional and physical distress. Therapy might help. You can try Betterhelp - an online counseling platform. BetterHelp makes professional counseling available anytime, anywhere, through a computer, tablet, or smartphone (we’re not cooperating with Betterhelp and this is only a suggestion). Another idea is to try something more self-served and cheaper solutions like the Calm app. They have a special program to deal with the anxiety (I personally use it during a very hectic period in my life and truly recommend it but again, I am not cooperating with The Calm app and this is only a suggestion).
2. Exercises, there are hundreds of online training these days on Youtube and Facebook.
3. Keep a positive attitude - try to not read news about the pandemic, lays off, and other negative stuff. I found RSS services helpful, because I want to be still connected to the world and at the same time avoid pandemic news. RSS is a feed aggregator where you can easily manage and arrange news interesting for you.
4. Focus on your hobby or find a new one. You can try this website for example https://mymodernmet.com/online-painting-tutorials/.

## BENEFITS
**Unemployment**
The German federal government offers unemployment benefits to anyone without work.

There are two types of unemployment benefit in Germany:

- unemployment benefit I and,
- unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld I and Arbeitslosengeld II).

### Unemployment benefit I
**(Arbeitslosengeld I)**
If you are an unemployed worker who has previously been making regular contributions to the German social security system, you may be eligible for unemployment benefit I. This provision is offered by the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit) to cover you while you look for a job. The amount you receive, and the duration, depends on how long you have been contributing and the salary you received before you became unemployed.
Unemployment benefit I requirements
In order to qualify for unemployment benefit I, you must fulfill certain criteria:

- You are unemployed.
- You have registered as unemployed at your local employment office (Arbeitsamt).
- You have made at least 12 months’ worth of unemployment insurance contributions within the last 30 months (exceptions are made for any time taken out to raise children or due to illness).
- You are looking for a job subject to compulsory insurance that covers at least 15 hours per week.
- You are an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, or you hold a valid settlement permit or temporary residence permit that entitles you to work in Germany.

If you do not fulfill these requirements, you may be able to apply for unemployment benefit II.

**How much unemployment benefit will I get?**
The amount of benefit you receive is based on your average weekly pay in the 12 months before you became unemployed (known as the “assessment period”). Your benefit will be 60% of your previous average wage (or 67% if you have children), up to a maximum of 6.900 euros per month in West Germany and 6.450 euros in East Germany.
Your benefit payments will then be subject to taxes and social security contributions, just like a regular wage. These will automatically be taken from your benefit by the employment office before it is transferred to your bank account at the end of each month. This includes deductions for:

- Statutory health insurance (7,3-8,2% of your benefit)
- Pension insurance (9,45%)
- Unemployment insurance (1,2%)
- Long-term care insurance (1,025%)
- Income tax
- Solidarity surcharge

**How long can I claim unemployment benefit I for?**
The amount of time for which you are entitled to receive unemployment benefit I depends on your age and how long you have been in employment and contributing to unemployment insurance before you became unemployed:

**Period of contribution | Age | Entitlement period**

12 months | - | 6 months
16 months | - | 8 months
20 months. | - | 10 months
24 months | - | 12 months
30 months. | 50 | 15 months
36 months | 55 | 18 months
48 months | 58 | 24 months

How to apply for unemployment benefit I
If you find yourself unemployed and wish to apply for the unemployment benefit, you should take the following steps as soon as possible to ensure there is no delay in your payments.

1. Register yourself as a job-seeker
If you know in advance that you are going to be made redundant, register yourself at least three months before the end of your employment contract. If you do not have a notice period, or you become unexpectedly unemployed, you need to register within three days of finding out. This can be done online on the Federal Employment Agency’s website. Alternatively, you can call their free hotline on 0800 4 555500 or register in person.

2. Register in person
On your first day without work, at the latest, you need to register in person as unemployed at your local employment office. You will need to bring:

- Your ID card or passport (not a driving license)
- Your certificate of registration
- Your visa or residence permit (if applicable)
- Your dismissal/redundancy notice or an employment contract
- Your CV - it's quite different from a typical CVs

3. Fill out an Application for Unemployment Benefit form
You can get this form from the employment office; alternatively, it is available to download, fill out, and submit online. Note that the form is only available in German. At this stage, you can also work out how much unemployment benefit you are likely to receive.
You will receive a letter of confirmation in the post, usually within two weeks. You will also probably be invited to attend meetings with a counselor at the employment agency, where you will be expected to demonstrate the efforts you have made to find a job. Note that if you turn down job offers or any training / further education made available to you, your benefits payments can be reduced or stopped altogether.

### Unemployment benefit II

If you are not eligible for unemployment benefit I, or if you cannot ensure your subsistence adequately from all your income or assets, you can apply for a basic subsistence benefit, unemployment benefit II (Arbeitlosengeld II, often colloquially referred to as Hartz Vier, after the head of the committee whose recommendations in 2002 caused a restructuring of unemployment benefits in Germany). This benefit is also sometimes given as an income supplement for low-earners.
Unemployment benefit II requirements

**You are considered entitled to receive unemployment benefit II if you meet the following conditions:**

- You are aged between 15 and the statutory retirement age.
- You are able to work at least three hours a day under “normal conditions”.
- You are unable to meet your own necessary living expenses or those of members in your household, either by working or with help from others.
- You are an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, or you hold a valid settlement permit or residence permit that entitles you to work in Germany.

You must also be prepared to take part in “integration” measures designed to ensure your return to the workplace. This might include vocational training, further education, or work opportunities. If you reject an offer of employment or a place on a training course, your unemployment benefit might be reduced or stopped altogether.
If you are not capable of earning (e.g. due to illness or incapacity) but live in a joint household with someone who is entitled to unemployment benefit II, you will receive the social benefit (Sozialgeld). Both benefits are essentially the same in their basic components.

**Duration and value of unemployment benefit II**
Unemployment benefit is provided by your local job center (Jobcentre) as a flat cash benefit, intended to secure basic subsistence. The benefit is paid monthly, in advance, and you can usually receive it for 12 months before a re-assessment is necessary. The exact amount you will receive is dependent on your income, assets, and family situation.
Individuals receive unemployment benefit II in the form of a “basic needs rate” plus assistance with any additional needs, including accommodation and heating. The standard basic needs rates vary according to age:

**Age | Value (per month)**

Singles and single parents aged over 18 | 432 euros
Adults with a partner aged under 18 | 432 euros
Partners or married couples aged over 18 | 389 euros each
Children aged up to 6 years | 250 euros
Children aged 6 to 13 years | 308 euros
Children aged 14 to 17 years | 328 euros
Young people aged 18 to 24 years | 345 euros

In addition to standard basic needs rates, children and young adults are also eligible for various types of education and participation assistance, e.g. for school trips or supplies. To reduce reliance on unemployment benefit II, parents can also apply for the supplementary child allowance (Kinderzuschlag).

Additional support is also provided for:
- Pregnant women
- Single parents, according to the age and number of children
- Anyone with a disability who is capable of working
- For food, in cases of special dietary needs
- For water heating, where necessary
- Housing costs (if you receive unemployment benefit II for accommodation expenditure, you cannot apply for housing benefit)

**How to apply for unemployment benefit II**
Unemployment benefit II is intended as a “subordinate benefit”, meaning that it is only given when all other possible benefits have been paid out. Before you apply, you will be expected to have already applied for any other social security or assistance benefits you might be eligible for, including:

- Child benefit or child allowance
- (Reduced) early retirement pension
- Sickness benefit
- Housing benefit
- Maternity benefit
- Parental allowance

If you have exhausted all the above options and you still cannot meet your own basic living expenses, you may apply for unemployment benefit II by taking the following steps:

1. Register at your local job center
At this first appointment at your local job center, you will discuss your personal situation with the advisor. You will need to bring:
- Your ID card or passport (not a driving license)
- Your visa or residence permit (if applicable)
- Your social security ID (Sozialversicherungsausweis)

2. Fill out an Application for Unemployment Benefit II form
You will receive all the forms you need at your initial appointment; you can also download the necessary forms from the Federal Employment Agency’s website. The job center publishes advice on completing this form in various languages, including English. Staff members will also be able to advise you if you have any difficulties.

3. Submit your documents to the job center
As well as your completed application form, you will need to supply documents that prove your case. This varies according to your personal situation, but will usually include:

- Bank statements from the last six months
- Your rental contract
- Proof of living costs (i.e. bills for utilities)
- Details of your income and assets

Remember also to bring a valid form of ID to all of your job center appointments.
Your case will then be considered; if you are eligible to receive the benefit you will receive a notification with a schedule of payments in the post. You will also be informed of any further steps you need to take, such as attending appointments, applying for jobs, or undertaking training.

## HEALTH INSURANCE
Healthcare in Germany is divided into two sectors:

- the gesetzliche Krankenversicherung or Gesetzliche Krankenkasse (public health insurance or the statutory healthcare system, as the Germans prefer to call it)
- and private Krankenversicherung (private health insurance).

In Germany, it is a legal requirement to have some form of health coverage, whether public or private, and it is even a requirement when starting a job.

When you register as an unemployed person you will get your Gesetzliche Krankenkasse (the statutory healthcare system) covered, however, if you previously have chosen private Krankenversicherung (private health insurance) there is no way to getting out of your private insurance contract, unless you leave the country.

**The tl;dr is:**

- amplify your colleagues-- share or like their posts,
- write LinkedIn Recommendations,
- introduce them to recruiters from a previous job search or friends at other companies still hiring

**Try to be specific with any help you offer and avoid the overwhelming phrase "don't hesitate to reach out."**

I'd also recommend this piece to read on how to help your friend through a coronavirus layoff

## EMPLOYERS HOW YOU CAN HELP SECTION
I’m glad you're here! We hope some of this is helpful and welcome input if you'd like to share wisdom with other companies.
**Before Layoffs**

Laying off should be consulted with experts like lawyers, HR people, and Finance officers - that’s obvious, however, you will find below some good practices shared by Andreessen Horowitz and Beth Steinberg who fired people before. It might be beneficial to both your company and employees who still work with you.

**After Layoffs**

I might be biased but I’d recommend sharing this project with people who are laid-off.
I am also preparing To-Do List Support After Layoffs.

**Still Hiring?**

I hope there are companies unaffected by COVID - 19, who are still actively hiring. If you’re one of them, you can do a few things to contribute toward industry-wide solutions:
Sourcing Candidates

Source your candidate pipeline from layoff lists/trackers, either distributed by your investors or through sites listed below. Layoffs are currently affecting every sector (even parts of healthcare).

- Florian's List
- Trivago is planning a layoff
- Monese looking to close the company in Berlin
- Lime announced layoff
- Fab layoff
- Layoffs coronavirus tracker in Berlin
- Ex - Uber Marketing team also in Germany
- Rover lays off in Berlin

**Repost Open Jobs**

Repost open jobs frequently. If your careers page doesn't already mention when the posting was updated, consider adding it. Stale postings (2+ weeks old, especially if your company already had a round of layoffs) are unreliable when industry hiring needs are changing weekly. If you haven't already, add your open jobs to sites/lists like the following:

- Remote Jobs From 100+ Companies Hiring Remotely in February 2020
- StillHiring.io
- Coda.io - hiring list Germany + Europe
- Elpha - hiring list Germany + Europe
- LEVELS.FYI list

**Close Closed Jobs**

This sounds obvious, but if you're in a hiring freeze or otherwise not going to review inbound applications for the foreseeable future, don't accept them. Takedown job postings for which you aren't hiring.
Why? A lot of people are unemployed. Leaving hopeless job postings up costs them time and energy they could spend on stronger leads.
We get the impetus to keep building the pipeline, but be honest-- do you prioritize inbound applications anyway? Besides: With that many job seekers, there are likely to be plenty still looking (or coming back from taking a break) by the time you're actually ready to review them-- save it for the fresh leads and don't leave applicants hanging.
(If this means you have "nothing" for your recruiters to do, believe me, they probably have plenty of process improvement project ideas they've never had the chance to work on. If not, or they've already done them, you can set their skills to work on outreach-- hosting resume reviews, interview prep advice, etc that helps build your brand)

**Be Clear With Candidates**

Some sound obvious, but these are pain points we've heard are still happening:
If you're reaching out to someone unemployed, include whether your outreach is regarding a job opportunity, seeking advice, or something else. Jobseekers have to carefully prioritize time and energy (especially now). You being upfront helps them plan accordingly.
Avoid ghosting candidates you've spoken to. Keep them posted on when you expect to get back to them and follow through.
If things change (it happens), communicate that as quickly and clearly as you can.
Any feedback or advice you can offer when it doesn't work out? This will go a long way toward generating referrals for better-fit candidates and goodwill for later.
