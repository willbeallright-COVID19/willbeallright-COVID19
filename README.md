## ABOUT
One place for all necessary information during COVID-19 layoffs for employers, employees, and people who've been recently laid off.
The intention of this document is to put all necessary information in one easily accessible and community modifiable place.
Layoffs are hard and sucks. I just want to let you know you’re not alone.

I am located in Berlin, Germany, so I’m going to focus on the Germany area but if you have resources for another area please feel encouraged to send a PR!
P.S. Most of the informations are also applicable to other locations.

## ROADMAP
**What is it, and why this?**
In the middle of April 20', we decided at our company to act as a job finding concierge to each software engineer impacted by COVID-19 layoff in Germany. Of course, the pandemic has an impact on our team and growth too, however, we still have resources and market knowledge to help, and we think it’s the right thing to do.

During that time, while helping engineers to stay connected to job opportunities. We needed to find a lot of information ourselves. A massive volume of layoff news on the Internet like spreadsheets "who are hiring,"; "who is laying off"; Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook articles focused on the topic of COVID-19 layoff started to become unmanageable, it was difficult to separate accurate information from noise.

So, I was looking for a collaborative place where I can put all information found during our "concierge project" to share it with the community, especially because there are so much mutually exclusive information and so many amazing & helpful resources I had no idea of existing. I believe there should be an easily accessible place for people in need. And Github seems to be the place.

## WHO AM I
I am [Alex Jozwik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-jozwik-10182a7a/), ex-lawyer, ex-UN in Geneva and NYC, co-founder of CodersFirst and Diversity & Inclusion Advocate.

Disclaimer: I’m not your lawyer or a lawyer anymore, and I’m not a financial advisor. Any advice below is just that (advice. One person’s opinion). I wanted to centralize resources I’ve seen from news outlets and anyone else on the hunt for jobs right now.

Although most of the information I pulled here or going to pull were found or prepared for CodersFirst’s candidates, however, **willbeallright-COVID19** has no link to the company and is my private project. I will not comment specifically on CodersFirst.

I am motivated by a single purpose: To help employers, employees, and people who've been recently laid off a) help people stay connected to job opportunities b) help to find yourself in this unpleasant situation c) emotionally support d) give details and context on layoff topic well enough to make better decisions themselves.
The place aims to be practical (with concrete suggestions and pitfalls to avoid).

I would like to however stress that I am not perfect and the guide shouldn’t be seen as completed. A reference like this is always in process. That’s why I chose Github to enable the community to suggest improvements, contribute new sections, and call out anything that needs revision. I welcome (and will gladly credit) your help.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
I am building it as an open-source project. I add here or going to add information we found during our “concierge project”. I believe that community cooperation might be more beneficial than only my point of view, so I welcome active contributors!

## START FROM HERE
### After layoff notification
Breathe. I know being layoffs sucks and during the pandemic, time might be even harder to handle. Take your time. Breathe. It’s ok to feel sad, angry, or doubtfully, take care of yourself on every stage of the process.

Here is information you need to have after being notified about canceling your role. If HR people didn’t give you those details, reach out to them immediately.

1. How long the company is going to pay you?
2. Do you receive a severance package/pay?
3. How long will you have to exercise your stock options?
4. Do you receive references from the company?
5. By when can you keep a company computer/related equipment? This is also a really important question, especially when this is the only computer you own at the moment. All activities are remote now, public libraries are closed and it might be difficult to search for a new job without access to the internet. Also, many recruitment processes are conducting remotely. if you can’t keep the computer ask the company if you can keep it at least on loan until you find your next job.
6. What about all the personal items you have on the company computer? How can you get this information back? While you shouldn’t have personal data on the corporate machine, the reality is almost everyone does. Ask the company how much time do you have to get your files in order.

### Mental and physical health

1. Layoff may cause serious emotional and physical distress. Therapy might help. You can try [Betterhelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) - an online counseling platform. BetterHelp makes professional counseling available anytime, anywhere, through a computer, tablet, or smartphone (we’re not cooperating with Betterhelp and this is only a suggestion). Another idea is to try something more self-served and cheaper solutions like [the Calm app](https://www.calm.com/). They have a special program to deal with the anxiety (I personally use it during a very hectic period in my life and truly recommend it but again, I am not cooperating with The Calm app and this is only a suggestion).
2. Exercises, there are hundreds of online training these days on Youtube and Facebook.
3. Keep a positive attitude - try to not read news about the pandemic, lays off, and other negative stuff. I found RSS services helpful, because I want to be still connected to the world and at the same time avoid pandemic news. RSS is a feed aggregator where you can easily manage and arrange news interesting for you.
4. Focus on your hobby or find a new one. You can try this website for example [https://mymodernmet.com/online-painting-tutorials/](https://mymodernmet.com/online-painting-tutorials/).

## BENEFITS
### Germany
**Unemployment benefits in Germany**
The German federal government offers unemployment benefits to anyone without work.

There are two types of unemployment benefit in Germany:

- unemployment benefit I and,
- unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld I and Arbeitslosengeld II).

#### Unemployment benefit I
**(Arbeitslosengeld I)**
If you are an unemployed worker who has previously been making regular contributions to [the German social security system](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security), you may be eligible for unemployment benefit I. This provision is offered by the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit) to cover you while you look for a job. The amount you receive, and the duration, depends on how long you have been contributing and the salary you received before you became unemployed.
Unemployment benefit I requirements
In order to qualify for unemployment benefit I, you must fulfill certain criteria:

- You are unemployed.
- You have registered as unemployed at your local employment office (Arbeitsamt).
- You have made at least 12 months’ worth of unemployment insurance contributions within the last 30 months (exceptions are made for any time taken out to raise children or due to illness).
- You are looking for a job subject to compulsory insurance that covers at least 15 hours per week.
- You are an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, or you hold a valid settlement permit or temporary residence permit that entitles you to work in Germany.

If you do not fulfill these requirements, you may be able to apply for unemployment benefit II.

**How much unemployment benefit will I get?**
The amount of benefit you receive is based on your average weekly pay in the 12 months before you became unemployed (known as the “assessment period”). Your benefit will be 60% of your previous average wage (or 67% if you have children), up to a maximum of 6.900 euros per month in West Germany and 6.450 euros in East Germany.
Your benefit payments will then be subject to taxes and social security contributions, just like a regular wage. These will automatically be taken from your benefit by the employment office before it is transferred to your bank account at the end of each month. This includes deductions for:

- [Statutory health insurance](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/german-health-insurance/statutory-health-insurance-germany) (7,3-8,2% of your benefit)
- [Pension insurance](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/official-issues/pensions-retirement-age-germany) (9,45%)
- Unemployment insurance (1,2%)
- [Long-term care insurance](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/long-term-care-insurance-germany-pflegeversicherung) (1,025%)
- [Income tax](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/taxation-germany/german-tax-system)
- Solidarity surcharge

**How long can I claim unemployment benefit I for?**
The amount of time for which you are entitled to receive unemployment benefit I depends on your age and how long you have been in employment and contributing to unemployment insurance before you became unemployed:

**Period of contribution | Age | Entitlement period**

12 months | - | 6 months
16 months | - | 8 months
20 months. | - | 10 months
24 months | - | 12 months
30 months. | 50 | 15 months
36 months | 55 | 18 months
48 months | 58 | 24 months

How to apply for unemployment benefit I
If you find yourself unemployed and wish to apply for the unemployment benefit, you should take the following steps as soon as possible to ensure there is no delay in your payments.

1. Register yourself as a job-seeker
If you know in advance that you are going to be made redundant, register yourself at least three months before the end of your employment contract. If you do not have a notice period, or you become unexpectedly unemployed, you need to register within three days of finding out. This can be done online on [the Federal Employment Agency’s website](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/). Alternatively, you can call their free hotline on 0800 4 555500 or register in person.

2. Register in person
On your first day without work, at the latest, you need to register in person as unemployed at [your local employment office](https://con.arbeitsagentur.de/prod/apok/metasuche/suche/dienststellen). You will need to bring:

- Your ID card or passport (not a driving license)
- Your [certificate of registration](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/official-issues/registration-certificate-germany-anmeldebescheinigung)
- Your visa or residence permit (if applicable)
- Your dismissal/redundancy notice or an employment contract
- Your [CV](https://www.iamexpat.de/career/german-cv-guide-lebenslauf) - it's quite different from a typical CVs

3. Fill out an Application for Unemployment Benefit form
You can get this form from the employment office; alternatively, it is available to download, fill out, and submit online. Note that the form is only available in German. At this stage, you can also work out [how much unemployment benefit you are likely to receive](https://www.pub.arbeitsagentur.de/selbst.php?jahr=2018).
You will receive a letter of confirmation in the post, usually within two weeks. You will also probably be invited to attend meetings with a counselor at the employment agency, where you will be expected to demonstrate the efforts you have made to find a job. Note that if you turn down job offers or any training / further education made available to you, your benefits payments can be reduced or stopped altogether.

#### Unemployment benefit II

If you are not eligible for unemployment benefit I, or if you cannot ensure your subsistence adequately from all your income or assets, you can apply for a basic subsistence benefit, unemployment benefit II (Arbeitlosengeld II, often colloquially referred to as Hartz Vier, after the head of the committee whose recommendations in 2002 caused a restructuring of unemployment benefits in Germany). This benefit is also sometimes given as an income supplement for low-earners.
Unemployment benefit II requirements

**You are considered entitled to receive unemployment benefit II if you meet the following conditions:**

- You are aged between 15 and the statutory retirement age.
- You are able to work at least three hours a day under “normal conditions”.
- You are unable to meet your own necessary living expenses or those of members in your household, either by working or with help from others.
- You are an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, or you hold a valid settlement permit or residence permit that entitles you to work in Germany.

You must also be prepared to take part in “integration” measures designed to ensure your return to the workplace. This might include vocational training, further education, or work opportunities. If you reject an offer of employment or a place on a training course, your unemployment benefit might be reduced or stopped altogether.
If you are not capable of earning (e.g. due to illness or incapacity) but live in a joint household with someone who is entitled to unemployment benefit II, you will receive the social benefit (Sozialgeld). Both benefits are essentially the same in their basic components.

**Duration and value of unemployment benefit II**
Unemployment benefit is provided by your local job center (Jobcentre) as a flat cash benefit, intended to secure basic subsistence. The benefit is paid monthly, in advance, and you can usually receive it for 12 months before a re-assessment is necessary. The exact amount you will receive is dependent on your income, assets, and family situation.
Individuals receive unemployment benefit II in the form of a “basic needs rate” plus assistance with any additional needs, including accommodation and heating. The standard basic needs rates vary according to age:

**Age | Value (per month)**

Singles and single parents aged over 18 | 432 euros
Adults with a partner aged under 18 | 432 euros
Partners or married couples aged over 18 | 389 euros each
Children aged up to 6 years | 250 euros
Children aged 6 to 13 years | 308 euros
Children aged 14 to 17 years | 328 euros
Young people aged 18 to 24 years | 345 euros

In addition to standard basic needs rates, children and young adults are also eligible for various types of education and participation assistance, e.g. for school trips or supplies. To reduce reliance on unemployment benefit II, parents can also apply for the supplementary child allowance (Kinderzuschlag).

Additional support is also provided for:
- Pregnant women
- Single parents, according to the age and number of children
- Anyone with a disability who is capable of working
- For food, in cases of special dietary needs
- For water heating, where necessary
- Housing costs (if you receive unemployment benefit II for accommodation expenditure, you cannot apply for housing benefit)

**How to apply for unemployment benefit II**
Unemployment benefit II is intended as a “subordinate benefit”, meaning that it is only given when all other possible benefits have been paid out. Before you apply, you will be expected to have already applied for any other social security or assistance benefits you might be eligible for, including:

- [Child benefit](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/child-benefits-germany-kindergeld) or [child allowance](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/child-benefits-germany-kindergeld)
- (Reduced) early retirement pension
- [Sickness benefit](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/sickness-benefit-germany-krankengeld)
- [Housing benefit](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/housing-benefit-germany-wohngeld)
- [Maternity benefit](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/maternity-benefit-germany-mutterschaftsgeld)
- [Parental allowance](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/social-security/parental-allowance-germany-elterngeld)

If you have exhausted all the above options and you still cannot meet your own basic living expenses, you may apply for unemployment benefit II by taking the following steps:

1. Register at your [local job center](https://con.arbeitsagentur.de/prod/apok/metasuche/suche/dienststellen)
At this first appointment at your local job center, you will discuss your personal situation with the advisor. You will need to bring:
- Your ID card or passport (not a driving license)
- Your visa or residence permit (if applicable)
- Your social [security ID (Sozialversicherungsausweis)](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/official-issues/social-security-id-germany-sozialversicherungsausweis)

2. Fill out an Application for Unemployment Benefit II form
You will receive all the forms you need at your initial appointment; you can also download the necessary forms from the Federal Employment Agency’s website. The job center publishes advice on completing this form in various languages, including English. Staff members will also be able to advise you if you have any difficulties.

3. Submit your documents to the job center
As well as your completed application form, you will need to supply documents that prove your case. This varies according to your personal situation, but will usually include:

- Bank statements from the last six months
- Your rental contract
- Proof of living costs (i.e. bills for utilities)
- Details of your income and assets

Remember also to bring a valid form of ID to all of your job center appointments.
Your case will then be considered; if you are eligible to receive the benefit you will receive a notification with a schedule of payments in the post. You will also be informed of any further steps you need to take, such as attending appointments, applying for jobs, or undertaking training.

### Austria
**Unemployment benefits in Austria**
**How to apply for unemployment benefit?**
In Austria, the leading provider of labor-market related services is Austrian Public Employment
Service (AMS). If you find yourself unemployed and wish to apply for the unemployment benefit, you
should take the following steps:
1. Register yourself as unemployed – please note that you can do it on the first day after the
employment relationship ended at latest or before the end of your employment contract if
you know the exact date when you will become unemployed (this does not apply to claims
for unemployment benefit). This is crucial for the continuity of your insurance. There are
several ways, how you can do it: through a personal eAMS-account or the AMS website, via
post or fax, by phone and via email.
2. Apply for unemployment benefit appropriate to your current situation through a personal
eAMS-account or contact AMS directly. Make sure you are eligible for a benefit that you are
applying for.

**What unemployment benefits does AMS offer?**
Please note that the forms of unemployment benefit as well as its conditions and amounts may differ
between Austria’s provinces.

1. Unemployment benefit – 55% of your net salary
2. Unemployment benefit and unemployment insurance in EWR countries or in Switzerland
3. AQUA – Job-related qualification support – financial support to cover the costs of living when
you pursue a qualification necessary to get a specific job
4. Integration support – financial support to employers that decide to hire an unemployed
person that is over 50 years old or is unemployed for a longer time
5. Commuting allowance – for an unemployed person that accepted a job or an apprenticeship
that is situated further away from their home
6. Unemployment exemptions – financial support to cover broadcasting fees or prescriptions
for medications
7. Emergency assistance – when a person is still unemployed, but is not eligible for
unemployment benefit anymore
8. Guaranteed minimum benefit – to cover costs of living of a person who is unemployed and
its family
9. Job application benefit – financial support to cover the traveling costs for job interviews to
other regions than where a person lives
10. Housing benefit – financial support to help cover the housing costs

COVID-19 short-time work system has been introduced to save jobs. A person can still receive 80-
90% of their pay, although their work-time got reduced maximum to 10%. This system may be
applied for maximum 3 months at first. If all requirements are fulfilled, it can be prolonged for
another 3-months-period.

## HEALTH INSURANCE
[Healthcare in Germany](https://www.internations.org/go/moving-to-germany/healthcare) is divided into two sectors:

- the gesetzliche Krankenversicherung or Gesetzliche Krankenkasse (public health insurance or the statutory healthcare system, as the Germans prefer to call it)
- and private Krankenversicherung (private health insurance).

In Germany, it is a legal requirement to have some form of health coverage, whether public or private, and it is even a requirement when starting a job.

When you register as an unemployed person you will get your Gesetzliche Krankenkasse (the statutory healthcare system) covered, however, if you previously have chosen private Krankenversicherung (private health insurance) there is no way to getting out of your private insurance contract, [unless you leave the country](https://www.klforexpats.com/2020/01/30/cancel-german-health-insurance/).

## ALL - in - one GUIDES
Compiled and regularly added community-sourced resources into a [central job-searching list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ALcEcvgl9RHKt8owu94zB_ZcbsaHgyhZrSjpjNj16_8/edit#gid=0). Every job board and talent list recently launched is in this list

## NEXT JOB SECTION
### Get organized

Having a lot on your plate surely doesn’t make the job hunt any easier, but don’t worry - as David Allen says in his “Getting Things Done” bestseller, your mind will be more sharp, focused and calm as soon as you have written down your TO-DOs. Getting organized is the key!

**First: Schedule your day**

The fact you’ve been let go shouldn’t be an excuse to sleep in till noon, eat pizza and watch Netflix all day. I guarantee you’re going to feel way better as soon as you do as little as get dressed and plan your day just a bit. Setting one task for yourself to complete that day should be good enough to start!
The sooner you get out of despair, the sooner you’ll get back on track.
You can use Google calendar or Trello board to plan your day. Example TRELLO board (it’s a free tool) [HERE](https://trello.com/b/bamxAupz/job-hunting).

Everyone does better with some structure in life and plan. External accountability can also be useful for many people, so feel free to find a person who can check your progress regularly. 

**Second: Job ads research**

One of the tasks you can choose for yourself is going through job ads that might interest you and collect them in one place (an example of a tracking system can be found in the section below). Obviously there’s no need to dig through the entire internet in one day and it can actually be a good idea to check each website e.g. twice a week to see if there are any new ads that might be interesting for you.

- [StackOverFlow Talent](https://stackoverflow.com/talent/en)

*NOTE: Don’t put your phone number on your resume for these sites unless you want people to cold call you!*

**Third: Tracking system**

The best way to manage and control your job search is by using a simple tracking system. I’ve prepared an example for you [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gz1OmLVlEkhWe5ihM0kIr4Enh3ULslERrCYkLgLbEfo/edit?usp=sharing), feel free to copy it and adjust to your needs. :)

It’s a simple spreadsheet where you should put all the recruitment information, statuses, your impressions etc. It will give you a brilliant overview of what’s going on in each case without cluttering your memory.

### Set up your job search materials

**Prepare your resume**

**One CV might not be enough. Why?**
- When sending your application, it may happen you will not be sending your CV to a human being, but to a system (ATS - Applicant Tracking System) that will be extracting data from the pdf/docx etc. For instances when you’re not interacting with a human, it’s best to prepare a CV with as little graphics as possible so that the system can extract the necessary information without which your application cannot be further processed. 
- Otherwise, when sending your CV directly to a recruiters inbox this is when a good CV design can come in handy.
- If you’re thinking about applying for several different positions it might make sense to make a separate CV for each of them. Thanks to this you can stress the necessary keywords recruiters will be looking for which might vary from job to job.

Best practices for:
- [ATS compliant resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_YtM4LKItgAR5ledzLVSyA3PXPNEDodhX4VD2-uMw0/edit?usp=sharing),
- [General resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVxl-TWPfGjZQK_93AVJTa2qC3ig3r0U9yxZmvIIpUo/edit?usp=sharing).

**Improve your online presence**

It’s a good practice to set it up before you start sending resumes as lots of companies will conduct a quick social media check before inviting you for an interview. And the most common media used for a job search is Linkedin. 

**Here are a few tips on how to improve your visibility to recruiters on Linkedin:**
- If you don’t have a profile picture, upload one that is professional
- Insert keywords to your profile relevant to the position you’re looking for. Use the space in your title, job description and summary. EXAMPLE: If you’re looking for a Python Engineer position, it would make sense to include the word “Python”/”Django” (depending which technologies interest you) in the title or summary instead of a generic “Software Engineer”. It will help recruiters find you!
- Fill in the “Skills” section with the skills necessary for the job (the ones that you have or are working on). You can ask your friends or colleagues to endorse you.
- Let recruiters know you’re open to job opportunities (turn [this feature on](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405?lang=en))
- Add “open to new opportunities” in the title
- Describe in the summary the most recent project you have worked on or the one you think was the most ambitious

### Networking
Remember you’re not the only one in this situation. It’s actually a good idea to find others and connect with them - share resources, ideas and anything you’d like. Don’t underestimate the power of a community!
- Look out for the hashtags #Coronahilfe, #Nachbarschaftshilfe and #Nachbarschaftschallenge (neighbourhood help/neighbourhood challenge) for local initiatives. Those are used widely regarding any help people need during the coronavirus pandemic.
- Look for Facebook groups - following up the #Coronahilfe there are groups created for regions or cities in Germany, e.g. in Dusseldorf here: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/210721353668391/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/210721353668391/)
- You can also check [HireClub Germany](https://hireclub.com/communities/germany) - it is a group to help facilitate peer to peer job referrals, there is a community in Germany too.
- [Hire Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/) is a community with a specific purpose to hire/get women hired.
- [Elpha](https://elpha.com/) - community for women in tech. This is not specifically for job hunting, however there is a job board you can go through and for sure a very supportive community too!
- [Willbeallright.Covid19 slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T012M75TN93/C012FS773U6)  where we share tips and for example CV consultation
- Alumni network from your former companies - it could be a nice experience to connect with people who used to work at the same company that you have. They might be in a similar situation or be able to help you using their connections.

### Preparing for Interviews
*“Before anything else, preparation is the key to success”* - said by Alexander Graham Bell could not be more accurate here. This is why you should always prepare for the interview to increase your chances of getting hired. Obviously there are always factors like skills and culture fit, but there are some universal values a lot of companies are paying attention to. **Remember, failing to prepare is preparing to fail!**

Below you can find several useful tips and resources that should help you prepare:

### Offers and Negotiating
Considering the current situation, it might be hard to negotiate and probably lots of people will take lower-paying jobs just to make ends meet. And that’s okay, no shame in that! Everyone is aware of what’s going on in the economy right now and even if you decide to pursue something entirely different it won’t be seen negatively by recruiters in the future.

## EMPLOYEES HOW YOU CAN HELP SECTION
**The tl;dr is:**

- amplify your colleagues-- share or like their posts,
- write LinkedIn Recommendations,
- introduce them to recruiters from a previous job search or friends at other companies still hiring

**Try to be specific with any help you offer and avoid the overwhelming phrase "don't hesitate to reach out."**

## EMPLOYERS HOW YOU CAN HELP SECTION
I’m glad you're here! We hope some of this is helpful and welcome input if you'd like to share wisdom with other companies.
**Before Layoffs**

Laying off should be consulted with experts like lawyers, HR people, and Finance officers - that’s obvious, however, you will find below some good practices shared by Andreessen Horowitz and Beth Steinberg who fired people before. It might be beneficial to both your company and employees who still work with you.

**After Layoffs**

I might be biased but I’d recommend sharing this project with people who are laid-off.
I am also preparing To-Do List Support After Layoffs.

**Still Hiring?**

I hope there are companies unaffected by COVID - 19, who are still actively hiring. If you’re one of them, you can do a few things to contribute toward industry-wide solutions:
Sourcing Candidates

Source your candidate pipeline from layoff lists/trackers, either distributed by your investors or through sites listed below. Layoffs are currently affecting every sector (even parts of healthcare).

**Repost Open Jobs**

Repost open jobs frequently. If your careers page doesn't already mention when the posting was updated, consider adding it. Stale postings (2+ weeks old, especially if your company already had a round of layoffs) are unreliable when industry hiring needs are changing weekly. If you haven't already, add your open jobs to sites/lists like the following:

**Close Closed Jobs**

This sounds obvious, but if you're in a hiring freeze or otherwise not going to review inbound applications for the foreseeable future, don't accept them. Takedown job postings for which you aren't hiring.
Why? A lot of people are unemployed. Leaving hopeless job postings up costs them time and energy they could spend on stronger leads.
We get the impetus to keep building the pipeline, but be honest-- do you prioritize inbound applications anyway? Besides: With that many job seekers, there are likely to be plenty still looking (or coming back from taking a break) by the time you're actually ready to review them-- save it for the fresh leads and don't leave applicants hanging.
(If this means you have "nothing" for your recruiters to do, believe me, they probably have plenty of process improvement project ideas they've never had the chance to work on. If not, or they've already done them, you can set their skills to work on outreach-- hosting resume reviews, interview prep advice, etc that helps build your brand)

**Be Clear With Candidates**

Some sound obvious, but these are pain points we've heard are still happening:
If you're reaching out to someone unemployed, include whether your outreach is regarding a job opportunity, seeking advice, or something else. Jobseekers have to carefully prioritize time and energy (especially now). You being upfront helps them plan accordingly.
Avoid ghosting candidates you've spoken to. Keep them posted on when you expect to get back to them and follow through.
If things change (it happens), communicate that as quickly and clearly as you can.
Any feedback or advice you can offer when it doesn't work out? This will go a long way toward generating referrals for better-fit candidates and goodwill for later.
